[{"body":"There are basically three main issues:\nDocumenting C++20 (specifically: concepts) At the time of writing, Hyde doesn’t support C++ concepts yet, which I plan to use extensively. The code still compiles (because clang can compile it) but Hyde ignores require statements. Its reaction to concept declarations isn’t tested.\nThe current behavior is that require does not show up in the declaration:\ntemplate \u003cstd::regular T\u003e class myClass; simply appears in the API docs as:\ntemplate \u003cclass T\u003e class myClass; which is a lot more generic and may not give a precise idea on what’s going on. It’s flat out wrong.\nAt the time of writing, I can live with this though. The OpenFOAM fork needs to compile with clang Basically, any dependency code you rely on, as well as your own libraries, need to compile with clang. Foam-Extend, for example, doesn’t, since clang thinks some calls to operators between tmp objects are unambiguous.\nAlso, even with the forks which mostly compile with clang, they frequently use [[deprecated]] to make the compiler mark functions and methods as deprecated. But, they do not maintain the inline docs to match the deprecated docs.\nHyde actually sets compiler deprecation warnings as errors by default. We have to skip this step, and as a result we lose the automatic synchronization between code and API docs.\nLinking to actual source files Personally I don’t like to link API docs to actual source files, but it can be useful to those who don’t spend as much time in a CLI environment. I still think It’s the job of your IDE to show where stuff are, and to show you the documentation too though.\nHyde can generate source file relationships if we add -hyde-src-root to the call but this clutters the left sidebar with unwanted content; I process resulting markdown files with a Python script afterwards to minimize the clutter.\nBecause Hyde processes the expanded AST of C++ files, it doesn’t report line numbers for declarations and definitions for now.\nRecap The whole system can crumble very easily.

For my PhD project, I would need to live through this hell for around three years. Specifically, OpenFOAM libraries are dependencies for me and that is a big deal for few reasons:\nWhich OpenFOAM fork to use? OpenFOAM forks from OpenCFD and Foundation are changing too quickly and Foam-Extend practically gets too little updates. My customizations will not fit as changes upstream OpenFOAM maintainers would be interested in merging; simply because they are mostly “experimentation” and maybe meshless-specific. I only need a very small set of OpenFOAM libraries to start and I don’t see a way to efficiently leverage the full set of libraries because most of them are optimized for FVM. This practically applies to any library that is hard to merge my changes into and gets frequent updates.\nDependency management workflow The workflow to manage my dependencies revolves around the following concepts and ideas:\nI need a way to significantly customize OpenFOAM libs while keeping the ability to pull updates from upstream repo. Keep the full git history for each file I use from the upstream repo. Switching dependency libs should be easy. A few conflicts are fine, but no significant code refactoring should be necessary. How to make OpenFOAM libs available as dependencies There are scripts to automatize this process, but I will explain the most important steps here:\nWe start by cloning the OpenFOAM project, filtering the paths we need (You’ll need git-filter-repo for this).\ngit clone https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam /tmp/openfoam-scratch cd /tmp/openfoam-scratch git filter-repo --path COPYING --path Allwmake --path bin --path etc --path src/Allwmake \\ --path src/OSspecific --path src/OpenFOAM --path src/Pstream/ \\ --path META-INFO/ --path wmake --force Next, in the target project repo, add the mutilated OpenFOAM repository as a subtree, and make a branch for original OpenFOAM commits there:\ncd /path/to/repo/root git subtree add --prefix dependencies/meshfree-openfoam /tmp/openfoam-scratch/ master git checkout -b original-openfoam Switch back to master (or whatever your main branch is called), do some changes, and commit:\ngit checkout master git add -A git commit -m \"Update OpenFOAM compilation\" The changes you make will obviously be related to your target project, so it’s a good idea to keep those commits in your main repository instead of managing a zillion dependency repositories.\nUpdates from the original repo come in two forms:\nNew change commits. These may cause conflicts with our changes, so rebasing will allow us to solve them if done frequently enough. New libraries we want to add. These are also new commits, but we know they won’t cause trouble since they only add files to original branch. We only have to remember to update Allwmake scripts to compile those new libraries. Here is how to add src/fileFormats and src/surfMesh libraries from OpenFOAM:\n# Create a new filtered repo with the new libs rm -rf /tmp/openfoam-scratch git clone https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam /tmp/openfoam-scratch cd /tmp/openfoam-scratch git filter-repo --path COPYING --path Allwmake --path bin --path etc --path src/Allwmake \\ --path src/OSspecific --path src/OpenFOAM --path src/Pstream/ \\ --path META-INFO/ --path wmake --path src/fileFormats --path src/surfMesh --force # Merge those commits into master cd /path/to/repo/root git checkout original-openfoam git subtree pull --prefix dependencies/meshfree-openfoam /tmp/openfoam-scratch/ master git checkout master # This merge has less chance of producing conflicts if you're just adding libs. git merge original-openfoam # On master, don't forget to update Allwmake to compile the new libs if necessary This workflow maintains a healthy level of consistency and makes it easy to experiment with dependency library modifications (e.g. Optimization for GPU, …, etc) and even changing compiler settings.\n","categories":"","description":"During the design phase of `MeshFreeFoam`, It was obvious that I would need to rely on few c++ libraries.

After having some suspicions, I had a discussion with @holger on the details of using tmp to get things out of function scope. As I’ve skimmed through the code, I started to think of it as a lazy evaluation thing (which is not true). The main reason was that I would encounter operations of this signature tmp\u003cT\u003e BINARY_FUNCTION(T vf1, T vf2) more and more.\nSo, I went and added Info statements to the fields constructors, and discovered that\na = b + c + d; // as fields would not construct two (from eagerly-doing the plus operations) but just one temporary object is created. This tricked me into thinking that those operations are done lazily. In fact, The same memory is reused for both operations, which does save up on memory allocation, but memory reads/writes still get carried out at the same spots as in traditional eager evaluation.\nIt seems that tmp was originally designed to optimize memory handling which has improved a lot in newer C++ standards. A recent C++ compiler performs move construction/assignment on return statements instead of copying which makes tmp redundant in this regard:\n// Assume Field\u003cscalar\u003e has a move constructor and assignment operator scalarField add(const scalarField\u0026 a, const scalarField\u0026 b) { return a + b; } scalarField c(add(a,b)); // This will move-construct c from result of a+b // Older compilers will do a copy; that's why most functions return a tmp Thus, tmp has nothing to do with lazy evaluation, but computing linear combinations of stuff is all we do in CFD, and MeshFreeFoam is no exception. Being able to compute ${\\bf x_1} + a {\\bf x_2}$ efficiently is crucial. Here is the landscape of how efficient we can be:\nRegular C++: compute $a {\\bf x_2}$ then add it to ${\\bf x_1}$. Which is too wasteful (keeps allocating and discarding temporary memory chunks). With OpenFOAM’s tmp: saves on new memory allocation on addition but is still wasteful when it comes to CPU cycles. (?) With lazy evaluation: perform operations only when needed and at the tightest memory scope possible. Despite being a .Net language, F# (and most of other functional languages) nailed on-demand computation. In an attempt to bring that level of functionality to my PhD project, I investigate how would lazy evaluation be implemented for OpenFOAM-based code.\nLazy evaluation with expression templates The first candidate was expression templates. I have heard of this concept countless times before. I even had my own my matrix implementation that allowed to perform operations only on a subset of rows/columns lazily. While that is not so useful now, being familiar with the concept helps. Also, with C++17 and newer standards, the implementation of expression templates has become much easier compared to five or six years back.\nOne inherent drawback of a rigorous implementation of expression templates is that they can add some considerable complexity to the code in regard of ordering computations:\n// Assume \u003c\u003c, + and * are implemented with expression templates a \u003c\u003c b + c; // using \u003c\u003c to denote that this is not an assignment; take it as a mere labeling operation // a not used, so, let's not compute it yet b = 1; // now this is an assignment d \u003c\u003c a * 2; // Which values of b were used here? b = 1; but was that intended? That said, the performance benefit of implementing expression templates is enormous. It’s at least 50% faster than eager evaluation for few operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction and division of scalar arrays).\nThus, the next best thing, is a partial template expression system which evaluates on assignment to avoid the confusion, so not truly lazy, but somewhere in between. Even then, I will have to maintain the whole system while keeping it compatible with OpenFOAM’s API. Instead, I started to look at the news ranges from C++20 standard library.\nLazy evaluation with views In particular, C++20 introduces views which are special kinds of ranges which do not own their data. For our purposes, think of them as views into (parts of) the CFD fields. These were perfect for other purposes too, for example, implementation of fit-in-L2-cache subdomains for MeshFreeFoam.\nThe biggest problem with views is the thin compiler support. For example, to use zip_transform which allows to do operations on multiple views at one (eg. binary functions), we have to use at least GCC 13 and link against C++23.\nThe performance benefits are very close to what expression templates provide; at much less maintainability cost; but the uncertainty around them is much higher because of the thin support.\nWarning NVIDIA’s HPC c++ compilers at the moment support only C++17; using stdpar will prove difficult if decided to use views. So, for now, it’s either to optimize for CPU; or use the GPU. We can’t do both as working comfortably with views requires C++23. Thus, building a system on top of views is probably not a good idea when it comes to API stability. But there is always the ranges-v3 library which will hopefully cover anything that the standard libraries might miss. My only concern is that I will not have enough time to wait for standard updates; if anything is missing in c++23 standard library, I will have to switch to ranges-v3 for quite some time or ditch the idea.\nThe benchmarks You can take a look at the benchmark results at this dedicated repository (at the end of compile and test step) which reflect what is shown in the animation above (m, rho, …, etc are all scalar fields). The CI workflows there perform the benchmarks on Github machines (which are not the fastest) so, compared to HPC nodes, results are a little exaggerated.\nThe correctness and performance of the testing code are recorded by foamUT; my unit-testing framework for OpenFOAM code (hence MeshFreeFoam too).\nFor the sake of exploring the effects of template expressions, I stole and used a trivial implementation:\nTemplate expression for binary operations on containers in C++ template\u003cclass T, class U, class Callable\u003e struct BinaryContainerExpression { template\u003cclass Func\u003e BinaryContainerExpression(const T\u0026 _left, const U\u0026 _right, Func\u0026\u0026 _callable) : left_{\u0026_left}, right_{\u0026_right}, callable_{std::forward\u003cFunc\u003e(_callable)} { assert(_left.size() == _right.size()); } auto operator[](size_t index) const { return callable_((*left_)[index], (*right_)[index]); } size_t size() const { return left_-\u003esize(); } const T* left_= nullptr; const U* right_= nullptr; Callable callable_; }; Not suitable for production code. I’m sure I can add syntactic sugar, but that’s not the point. It’s worth noting that on GitHub machines the execution time of lazy evaluations is a third of that of eager evaluations; while on my local machine, it’s around 50%. For the record, the test machine has the following properties:\nSystem: Kernel: 5.15.0-10078* x86_64 bits: 64 compiler: N/A Desktop: Gnome 3.36.9 Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa) CPU: Topology: 8-Core model: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics bits: 64 type: MT MCP arch: Zen 3 L2 cache: 4096 KiB flags: avx avx2 lm nx pae sse sse2 sse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 sse4a ssse3 svm bogomips: 102207 Speed: 1254 MHz min/max: 1200/3200 MHz Core speeds (MHz): 1: 1275 2: 1191 3: 1139 4: 1227 5: 1134 6: 1135 7: 1297 8: 1296 9: 1135 10: 1135 11: 1135 12: 1133 13: 1286 14: 1171 15: 1517 16: 1161 Conclusion If GPU acceleration is not important, Views are the best course of action.

It’s one of two things, the other being their runtime reflection systems. This feature is not exclusive to .Net languages; it’s found in all reflective languages (e.g., JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, Julia, etc.), except for C++.\nThe perfect implementation of a reflection system for OpenFOAM-based code will:\nBe fully implemented at compile-time (with zero runtime cost) but allow access to reflection information at runtime. Be compatible with the runtime selection mechanism. Support automatic serialization to JSON/XML for creating objects from a Web UI (or a TUI for that matter). Support building efficient proxy classes for objects to expose (private? protected?) fields to Web UI widgets. Current plans It doesn’t seem like a lot of work, but the challenges lie in meeting my specific requirements 1 and 2 above. There are few ways to achieve this:\nBuilding a C++ Reflection System in One Weekend Using Clang and LLVM demonstrates a method using compiler magic to generate reflection code. It parses the headers’ AST and generates C++ files to include in the final compilation units. This approach is not preferred due to two main reasons:\nIt requires annotating classes and fields for reflection. A separate tool must run on the classes’ headers with the correct compiler flags set to generate the reflection code, adding maintenance overhead. refl-cpp implements a version without parsing the AST, which is the preferred approach. It will serve as the main inspiration for developing the reflection system.\nC++ Reflection TS can be option for future projects. But as, at best, It’ll make into the standard by c++26, and we’ll have to wait for 1-2 years for compiler support, it’s better if we don’t rely on such experimental proposals. Currently, only clang can compile code from the proposal.\nWork on this front will begin as soon as I can visualize the meshfree domain (i.e., the particles) with ParaView. Immediate issues that must be addressed include:\nEnsuring both the reflection system and the runtime selection mechanism can coexist smoothly. Exposing fields of default OpenFOAM types (e.g., List, triSurface, etc.), which may not be trivial.

In fact, this has nothing to do with the RTS. It can be done to any class. Here is a quick animation illustrating the Interactive UI application from openfoam-reflections:\nUI for OpenFOAM RTS-based models (What doesn’t work) Pushing it a little further, can we walk users through the process of generating a valid dictionary for a baseModel to be constructed (!automatically!)? Envision the following workflow in case baseModel is both an abstract class and a base for dictionary-based runtime selection:\nPrompt users to pick a valid child for baseModel (In this case, present them with childModel as the only option) Keep prompting them for required members of childModel. Naturally we don’t want to hardcode the logic there; we want the compiler to generate the required code for us. This way, as we add class members, we won’t have to change the UI code. Well, it turns out we can achieve the first step by looking into the runtime selection table. But the next step is tricky since there will be a need to convert a string (user input) to a C++ type. The runtime selection table itself gets around this issue by keeping pointers to constructors. It’s not obvious to me how can we get hold of the concrete type at the moment. In addition, because the reflection is done at compile-time, the childModel header needs to be included in the UI code, which defeats the purpose of the RTS.\nAlso, some special members will need to be handled explicitly, such as having an autoPtr\u003csomething\u003e that initiates another RTS model.\nConclusion While the adopted reflection system has a variety of uses such as iterating over class’s member fields and functions, iterating over bases of a class, and even building powerful proxies, using to reflect RTS types doesn’t seem possible at the moment.\n","categories":"","description":"Updates on the progress made in the reflections system for MeshFreeFoam and setting functional requirements for it to be merged into the code.\n","excerpt":"Updates on the progress made in the reflections system for …","ref":"/MeshFreeFoam-Docs/blog/2023/10/02/a-reflection-system-for-meshfreefoam-part-2/","tags":["c++","quality-of-life","gui","openfoam"],"title":"A reflection system for MeshFreeFoam: Part 2"},{"body":"The previous post outlined the main challenges in implementing a decent reflection system for OpenFOAM while preserving the benefits of the runtime selection mechanism.\nIn this post, I describe the final state of the system and its limitations, along with some implementation details.\nMake classes reflect themselves?

Assume the following abstract base class, which has a few reflected members:\n# These are only reflected members of baseModel, it can have non-reflected ones baseModel |--\u003e key_ (autoPtr\u003cword\u003e) |--\u003e m_ (label) |--\u003e vv_ (Vector\u003cscalar\u003e) For the sake of code maintainability, let’s say that we have a static member of a template class builder\u003cT\u003e::schema() which returns the following dictionary if executed with [T = baseModel] (note that the RTS mechanism is consulted for available model options):\n{ baseModelType \"__one of ( childModel childModel1 childModel2 )__\"; key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } Such schema is possible to achieve entirely because of the compile-time reflection system and C++ concepts. But notice that once a user chooses an implemented model, the schema will be missing the members from the chosen childModel.\nA simple test of such schema methods:\nconstexpr bool hasSchema = SelfReflectableModel\u003cchildModel\u003e; if constexpr (hasSchema) { dict = schema\u003cchildModel\u003e(); } will result in the following schema:\n{ baseModelType childModel; type ; subModel { baseModelType \"__one of ( childModel childModel1 childModel2 )__\"; key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } for a child type which has the following members (Both the nested RTS model subModel_ and the type_ member now show up in the schema):\nchildModel : public baseModel |--\u003e type_ (word) |--\u003e subModel_ (autoPtr\u003cbaseModel\u003e) From this experiment, we deduce that generating schemas for abstract base classes is way less important than for concrete implementations of the target models.\nNote that the previous C++ code snippet features compile-time if statements which execute the schema method only if the target type is self-reflectable (a fancy way to say: the type has a schema method). If it is not the case, the compiler generates no code. Hence, the runtime cost occurs only if the type is self-reflectable, in which case, an OpenFOAM dictionary is built from the target type’s members.\nIn addition, concepts help generate code for specific cases. A good example is to fill the dictionary values with default-constructed values of the members only if the member type is default-constructible.\nSpecial cases for some class members can be also treated. As an example, take a member which is an autoPtr\u003cSomething\u003e. If the member points to a RTS-managed type (such us baseModel, childModel… etc), we will want to execute the schema function from that type. This is how the schema for the childModel::subModel_ for example is generated while generating the schema for childModel.\nIn the case of the pointed-to member type is not RTS-managed (eg. a simple word as in childModel::key_), we can assume that it’s an optional input and hint that assumption to the end user!\nRuntime selection to the rescue Reflection is traditionally tailored towards POD ( plain-old-data, which define little behavior ) structures, and using it together with the runtime selection mechanism proves to be difficult. One of the main issues that we particularly need the classes to generate their schema on their own is that we don’t want to include all headers in the application (include only those of the base classes), and allow users to dynamically load their libraries). One way of doing this would be to make the schema method an abstract method on base classes.\nOn the other hand, we need to generate a schema without creating any objects of the target type, so schema must also be static. Since there is no such thing as a static virtual method, we have to resolve this in another way.\nThese conflicting interests are the exact reason behind the runtime selection mechanism, so we can simply abuse to, instead of building a table of constructors, build a table of function points which points to a free method (or a static in a template class):\n// The table of function pointers (for illustration purposes only, function pointers are not stored like this) ( childModel \u0026builder\u003cchildModel\u003e::schema() childModel1 \u0026builder\u003cchildModel1\u003e::schema() childModel2 \u0026builder\u003cchildModel2\u003e::schema() ) Then we leverage the same mechanism ::New uses to create objects by looking up the table for the model we want; and then call the function through the stored function pointer.\nA recap of the API to generate model schemas The base block for the whole mechanism would be a static member method to generate a schema for the target type T. This method has to have all desired features (eg. can call itself if a member of T is an autoPtr\u003cU\u003e if U is also an RTS-managed class):\ndictionary builder\u003cT\u003e::schema() The next layer is a set of static members that need to be present on the base class. Basically, a hash table of regular function pointers, and a few methods to construct and destroy the table. A subclass to the base class is also need so we can use to add children to the table. All of this can be hidden behind a few macros easily.\nSimilarly to ::New(), base classes then can have a baseModel::schema(const word\u0026) static method which looks up the hash table for the passed-in model type name and calls the corresponding function.\nThe child classes will also have to initialize a static member for a specific type so they get added to the hash table automatically (static initialization happens before main).\nLet’s look at a full application example, which presents the user with available options for a baseModel and generates a schema for the chosen concrete implementation:\nNotice how there is no explicit mentioning of child classes.\n// OpenFOAM includes.... #include \"baseModel.H\" int main() { Info \u003c\u003c \"Choose a Model from available baseModels:\" \u003c\u003c endl; Info \u003c\u003c mff::baseModel::schemasPtr_-\u003etoc() \u003c\u003c endl; word modelType; std::getline(std::cin, modelType); Info \u003c\u003c \"Here is how you're supposed to construct a \" \u003c\u003c modelType \u003c\u003c endl; Info \u003c\u003c mff::baseModel::schema(modelType) \u003c\u003c endl; return 0; } { baseModelType childModel; type ; subModel { baseModelType \"__one of ( childModel childModel1 childModel2 )__\"; key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } Beautiful! 🎉 🥳\nGoing the extra-mile There a couple of loose ends to tie up:\nDefaulted values for members??? As it stands now, the schemas will suggest default values for members as in “default values for C++ types”. It would be interesting if we could extract the actual default values of the members as used in the target’s type construction (They properly have more physical meaning)!\nThis turns out not be so easy. One idea that comes to mind is to first create a schema for the target type ignoring all optional members; then use that schema to actually create an object of the target type. From there, it only remains to check the values of the optional members.\nBut this is not possible since objects can be created from all kinds of objects (and not just from a dictionary) and restricting that doesn’t look like a good idea.\nTo achieve this effect, we would have to use complex members holding their metadata; such as:\nclass baseModel { struct alpha { static constexpr int min_ = 0; static constexpr int max_ = 10; static const int default_ = 1; static constexpr std::string_view name_ = \"alpha\"; static constexpr std::string_view description_ = \"cool description of alpha\"; int v; } alpha; }; We could then use alpha.default to initialize alpha; and it is accessible through the reflection system. Since it’s a constexpr; this adds no runtime costs. The thing is, the default value for non-linear types will need to be initialized out-of-line. Using the reflection system for default values is possible for literal types only since non-literals cannot generally be constexpr (at the moment, there is no support for constexpr std::vector in any compiler!).\nComplete nested model schemas??? If we look closely at the generated schema from the previous example:\n{ baseModelType childModel; type ; subModel { baseModelType \"__one of ( childModel childModel1 childModel2 )__\"; key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } key \"__optional Foam::word here__\"; m 0; vv ( 0 0 0 ); } we can see that the subModel shows only members of the base class. To make it show the full array of members of the concrete type, the user can be prompted to pick a valid model, and then baseModel::schema(\"pickedModel\") will be called inside builder::schema\u003cbaseModel\u003e() instead of calling builder::schema\u003cmemberBaseType\u003e(). This scenario is particularly useful in building GUIs.\nConclusion At this point, all of the design goals mentioned back in Part 1 have been achieved. Except for minor changes, I will not develop the system any further.\nUse cases are exclusively (automatically) generating schemas for OpenFOAM classes and (again automatically) building GUI widgets for target types\nYou can find the final product with a sample application to iteratively generate a dictionary for some basic models at FoamScience/openfoam-reflections.\n","categories":"","description":"Finalized description of the reflection system for schema generation\n","excerpt":"Finalized description of the reflection system for schema generation\n","ref":"/MeshFreeFoam-Docs/blog/2023/10/05/a-reflection-system-for-meshfreefoam-part-3/","tags":["c++","quality-of-life","gui","openfoam"],"title":"A reflection system for MeshFreeFoam: Part 3"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/MeshFreeFoam-Docs/blog/discussions/","tags":"","title":"Discussions"},{"body":"This section is where the “user documentation” lives - all the\ninformation users need to understand and successfully use the project.\nSo, here it is.
