The unit tests pages are automatically generated from the test reports. Some important points to mention:
- The random number generator is seeded with the same seed for parallel/serial runs for the same test case.
- Number of passing tests is the "effective" one (including the ones that fail but are expected to fail)".
- Number of failing tests is the "effective" one (only the ones that fail and are not expected to fail)".

## Serial unit tests for `sampleClass` in `lib2` library on `[cavity]` case

Tests were performed using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) version `3.6.0` (rng-seed: `3966308918`) with the following filters: `[serial] [cavity] [#sampleClassTests]`.
