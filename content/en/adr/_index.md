We abuse ADRs to record any activity on the repo, may it be related to architecture, design, implementation or any other aspect that affects the project's future. ADRs are categorized by their status as follows:

- <i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-start -text-success"></i> Proposed ADR: written out, and was investigated
- <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass -text-success"></i> Under-review ADR: reviewing viability of acceptance
- <i class="fa-solid fa-check-square -text-primary"></i> Enforced ADR: accepted as viable, and set in effect
- <i class="fa-solid fa-square-xmark -text-danger"></i> Rejected ADR: dropped out
- <i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-start fa-rotate-180 -text-secondary"></i> Deprecated ADR: was in effect, but now preparing to retire
- <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-arrow-left -text-success"></i> Superseded ADR: was in effect, but was replaced by another decision
